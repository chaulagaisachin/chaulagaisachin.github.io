## Virtualization & Cloud Computing

This blog is a part of series I would be writing for beginners to learn and dive deeper into cloud computing, security & DevSecOps. After going through this series, you will be able to comprehend the concept of cloud computing & AWS, also work towards deploying applications in cloud infrastructure. But before understanding about cloud, you do need to have basic knowledge of how operating system works & a bit of networking. That’s all.

The first thing you need to know it, how’d this all started?

Back in days, the computer resources were every limited and efficient algorithm to do the calculation were in its beginning phase. However, as the time passed by, the computing resources were exponentially growing and the algorithm to solve problem were getting very efficient & productive. If you want to know more about history of virtulization, follow the link below:

Virtualization in computing has roots going back to the 1960s, with several key players shaping its evolution.

Moving on, the computer resources were enough to do stuff but now started remaining idle. They figured out how to divide physical resources into virtual ones, allowing them to be used for various purposes, which led to major advancements in computing. This method optimizes resource use by running multiple virtual machines on a single server, maximizing hardware utilization while cutting costs. It also offers scalability, allowing resources to be adjusted easily without major infrastructure changes, and improves disaster recovery by simplifying backups and restorations. The isolation provided by virtualization enhances security by reducing the risk of system-wide failures.

These innovations paved the way for cloud computing, where businesses can rent virtual resources over the internet instead of buying and maintaining their own servers.

With cloud computing, you can log into a provider’s console, rent whatever resources you need, and only pay for what you use, making the traditional procurement of server equipment unnecessary. This model revolutionized how businesses approach IT, offering flexibility, efficiency, and cost savings.
